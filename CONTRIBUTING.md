## How to author plugins
We like to keep plugins in separated repositories. We want to keep the main repository as small and simple as possible and we want to ensure a clear separation between the 
general framework and specific plugins. 

Using separated repositories also gives the authors the opportunity to keep the ownership and to be seen as contributors to the open source communitity, which we believe to 
be a quite honorably thing.  

## Definition Of Done
1. Tests are green
1. Technical test coverage is >80%. We even try to get above 90%.
1. Sonarcloud qualitygate is passed
